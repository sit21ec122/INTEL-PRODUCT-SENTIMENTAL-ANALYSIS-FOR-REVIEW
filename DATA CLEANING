DATA CLEANING
Raw data from reviews often contains noise and irrelevant information. Data cleaning involves:

Removing duplicates: Ensuring that duplicate reviews are identified and removed.
Handling missing values: Addressing any missing data points in the reviews.
Removing non-textual content: Stripping out any HTML tags, special characters, or non-alphabetic content.
Tokenization: Splitting the reviews into individual words or tokens.
import pandas as pd
import re
file_path = 'reviews.csv'
reviews_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
reviews_df.head()
